            Underverse is a captivating fan-made animated series created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaelarteo" target="_blank">Jael Pe√±aloza</a>, inspired by the critically acclaimed indie game Undertale, developed by Toby Fox. The series delves into the adventures of Sans, a beloved character from Undertale, as he journeys across the multiverse to confront a formidable and mysterious threat. Along the way, Sans encounters alternate versions of himself from various universes and timelines, each with their own unique traits and stories. Underverse masterfully combines action, drama, and emotional storytelling, making it a must-watch for fans of Undertale and multiverse narratives alike.

            I love Underverse because Undertale is my favorite game, and the series expands on its universe in such a creative way. The exploration of alternate universes and timelines is fascinating, offering fresh perspectives on familiar characters. Sans, in particular, is my favorite because of his wit, depth, and the way he adapts to the challenges of the multiverse.
