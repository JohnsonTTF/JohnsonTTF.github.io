            Underverse is a captivating fan-made animated series created by
            <special href="https://twitter.com/jaelarteo" target="_blank">Jael Pe√±aloza</special>
            , inspired by the critically acclaimed indie game Undertale, 
            developed by Toby Fox. The series delves into the adventures of Sans, 
            a beloved character from Undertale, as he journeys across the multiverse 
            to confront a formidable and mysterious threat. Along the way, Sans 
            encounters alternate versions of himself from various universes and 
            timelines, each with their own unique traits and stories. Underverse 
            masterfully combines action, drama, and emotional storytelling, 
            making it a must-watch for fans of Undertale and multiverse narratives 
            alike. (This content was created with the help of A.I.)

            I love Underverse because Undertale is my favorite game, and the 
            series expands on its universe in such a creative way. 
            The exploration of alternate universes and timelines is fascinating,
            offering fresh perspectives on familiar characters. Sans, in particular, 
            is my favorite because of his wit, depth, and the way he adapts to 
            the challenges of the multiverse. (This content was created with the
